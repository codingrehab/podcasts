<p>For the past six months we have been working with <code>Clojure</code> and the results are quite positive.</p>
<p>When we started it felt like re-learning habits and patterns that we thought we have mastered in <code>Java</code> and <code>C#</code>.</p>
<p>But soon enough we had our first application in production with a fraction of the effort that would have taken in <code>Java</code> and way more enjoyment.</p>
<p>We changed many habits that we had from procedural programming and we are learning new idioms every day not only from Clojure but also other functional languages like Haskell.</p>
<p>Seeing our positive was for us we decided that sharing our experience could benefit other developers, and inspire them to look into new technologies and functional languages.</p>
<p>In other words <em>coding rehab</em>.</p>
<p>We decided to record short podcasts (20 min or so) so they can be listened to while commuting (for example) from start to end.</p>
<p>Also each podcast will have a companion blog post to show examples and illustrate some of the concepts discussed.</p>
<p>We hope you like it!</p>
