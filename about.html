      <p>Amir started his career in 1994 working for IBM as a senior developer while he was finishing his Masters degree in computer science. Since then he worked as a software engineer and architect for the past 20 years.
      <p>Being an incurable geek, always thirsty for knowledge, his passion for technology moved him towards F# and after using it for six months he fell in love with it and with everything functional.</p>
      <p>Since then he spends his days working in Clojure and playing with Haskell.</p>
